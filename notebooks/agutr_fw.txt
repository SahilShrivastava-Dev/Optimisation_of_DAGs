### Understanding Transitive Reduction and Floyd-Warshall

**Transitive Reduction**: The transitive reduction of a directed graph is the smallest subgraph (with the fewest edges) that preserves the reachability of the original graph. An edge from node `i` to node `j` is kept only if it is necessary to maintain reachability from `i` to `j`, meaning there is no alternative path from `i` to `j` through other nodes.

**Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Typically used to find shortest paths in a weighted graph, it can be adapted to compute the transitive closure of a directed graph. The transitive closure tells us whether there is a path (of any length) from one node to another. Here, we use it to identify redundant edges by checking for alternative paths.

### Approach

1. **Convert Graph to Adjacency Matrix**: Map the graph dictionary to a matrix where `adj[i][j] = 1` if there’s a direct edge from node `i` to node `j`, and `0` otherwise.
2. **Compute Transitive Closure**: Use Floyd-Warshall to build a matrix where `closure[i][j] = 1` if there’s a path from `i` to `j` (including via the direct edge, if it exists).
3. **Determine Transitive Reduction**: For each direct edge `(i,j)`:
   - Check if there’s an alternative path from `i` to `j` via some intermediate node `k` (where `k ≠ i` and `k ≠ j`) by verifying if `closure[i][k] = 1` and `closure[k][j] = 1`.
   - If such a `k` exists, the edge `(i,j)` is redundant and can be removed (for DAGs).
   - If no such `k` exists, the edge is necessary and kept.
4. **Convert Back to Dictionary**: Build the reduced graph as a dictionary from the resulting matrix.

### Limitation

This method works correctly for DAGs, where removing an edge `(i,j)` when an alternative path exists preserves reachability. However, for graphs with cycles, it may incorrectly remove edges that are necessary to maintain reachability (e.g., in a cycle `A → B → C → A`, removing any edge breaks the cycle’s reachability). A more complex approach involving strongly connected components (SCCs) is needed for general graphs, but this solution focuses on simplicity and the use of Floyd-Warshall as requested.

### How It Works

#### Test Case 1: DAG
- **Input**: `{'a': ['b', 'c'], 'b': ['c'], 'c': []}`
- **Adjacency Matrix**:
  ```
  [
    [0, 1, 1],  # a → b, a → c
    [0, 0, 1],  # b → c
    [0, 0, 0]   # c → none
  ]
  ```
- **Transitive Closure**:
  ```
  [
    [1, 1, 1],  # a → a, b, c
    [0, 1, 1],  # b → b, c
    [0, 0, 1]   # c → c
  ]
  ```
- **Reduction**:
  - Edge `a → b` (0→1): No `k ≠ 0,1` where `closure[0][k] & closure[k][1]`. (`k=2`: `closure[0][2]=1`, but `closure[2][1]=0`). Keep.
  - Edge `a → c` (0→2): `k=1`, `closure[0][1]=1` & `closure[1][2]=1`. Remove.
  - Edge `b → c` (1→2): No `k ≠ 1,2` where `closure[1][k] & closure[k][2]`. (`k=0`: `closure[1][0]=0`). Keep.
- **Output**: `{'a': ['b'], 'b': ['c'], 'c': []}`

#### Test Case 2: Cycle
- **Input**: `{'a': ['b'], 'b': ['c'], 'c': ['a']}`
- **Adjacency Matrix**:
  ```
  [
    [0, 1, 0],  # a → b
    [0, 0, 1],  # b → c
    [1, 0, 0]   # c → a
  ]
  ```
- **Transitive Closure**:
  ```
  [
    [1, 1, 1],  # a → a, b, c
    [1, 1, 1],  # b → a, b, c
    [1, 1, 1]   # c → a, b, c
  ]
  ```
- **Reduction**:
  - Edge `a → b` (0→1): `k=2`, `closure[0][2]=1` & `closure[2][1]=1`. Remove.
  - Edge `b → c` (1→2): `k=0`, `closure[1][0]=1` & `closure[0][2]=1`. Remove.
  - Edge `c → a` (2→0): `k=1`, `closure[2][1]=1` & `closure[1][0]=1`. Remove.
- **Output**: `{'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': []}` (Incorrect for cycles; should keep the cycle.)

### Time Complexity
- **Floyd-Warshall**: O(n³), where `n` is the number of nodes.
- **Reduction Step**: O(n³) to check all edges and intermediate nodes.
- **Total**: O(n³).

### Note
This implementation is tailored for DAGs. For graphs with cycles, consider computing SCCs first (e.g., using Kosaraju’s or Tarjan’s algorithm) and applying a modified reduction that preserves connectivity within SCCs, but that’s beyond this scope since the query emphasizes Floyd-Warshall.
